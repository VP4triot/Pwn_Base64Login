# Pwn_BasicAuth
A script for testing SQLi over Basic Authentication Logins. I know basic auth do not use SQL by default but I had a lot of fun doing this script :D so give it a try and let's find out  if that horrible login is vulnerable. Let's pwn the world! (For good)

# Usage is really simple
python Pwn_BasicAuth.py https://mysite.com/
